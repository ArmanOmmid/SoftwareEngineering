### **My Interests**
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning, Psychology, Cognitive/Neuroscience, and Philosophy!
- Basketball, Tabletop Games, Video Games, Nature Hiking, Movies/TV Shows (Marvel!)... recently started exploring Scuba Diving!
- Also I don't know much about physics but I LOVE reading about it.

### **My Background**
- Raised and living in San Diego.
- Major: Computer Science \| Minor: Cognitive Science.
- Did a SWE internship at General Atomics over the summer.
- Have done many ML/DL projects on my own time.

### **My Career Plans**
- After graduating with my B.S. I plan to pursue graduate school and get a Master's Degree specializing in ML/DL/Computer Vision.
- However, I'm open-minded about exploring Cybersecurity and Quantum Computing. 
- I intend to work in the industry while I do my Master's, then work full time in the industry once I complete my Master's program. 

**Here is a picture of my face.**

It has many integrated and functional features... like eyes, a nose, and even a mouth.

Some inspirational ancient wisdom for you:

Here's an XOR Shift Random Number Generator I like to use (C++)... how fun!!! 
```
uint64_t xorshift(void) {
    static uint64_t x = 123456789;
    static uint64_t y = 362436069;
    static uint64_t z = 521288629;
    static uint64_t w = 88675123;
    uint64_t t;
    t = x ^ (x << 11);
    x = y; y = z; z = w;
    return w = w ^ (w >> 19) ^ t ^ (t >> 8);
}
```
