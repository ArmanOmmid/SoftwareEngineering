***Welcome to my User Page***

**My Interests**
Machine Learning / Deep Learning, Psychology, Cognitive/Neuroscience, and Philosophy! 
Basketball, Tabletop Games, Video Games, Nature Hiking, Movies/TV Shows (Marvel!)... recently started exploring Scuba Diving!
Also I don't know much about physics but I LOVE reading about it. 
**My Background**
Raised and living in San Diego.
Muir Senior - Majoring in Computer Science, Minoring in Cognitive Science.
Did a SWE internship at General Atomics over the summer.
Have done many ML / DL projects on my own time.
**My Career Plans**
After graduating with my B.S. I plan to pursue graduate school and get a Master's Degree specializing in ML / DL / Computer Vision.However, I'm open-minded about exploring Cybersecurity and Quantum Computing. 
I intend to work in the industry while I do my Masters, then work full time in the industry once I complete my Master's program. 

Here is a picture of my face. It has many integrated and functional features... like eyes, a nose, and even a mouth.

Here's an XOR Shift Random Number Generator I like to use (C++)... how fun!!! 
```
uint64_t xorshift(void) {
    static uint64_t x = 123456789;
    static uint64_t y = 362436069;
    static uint64_t z = 521288629;
    static uint64_t w = 88675123;
    uint64_t t;
    t = x ^ (x << 11);
    x = y; y = z; z = w;
    return w = w ^ (w >> 19) ^ t ^ (t >> 8);
}
```
